         Private family burial will take place at Cedar Memorial Park Cemetery. Arrangements entrusted to Cedar Memorial
         Park Funeral Home.</p>
      <p>Surviving in addition to her parents are her sisters, Aubree and Colie; her grandparents, John and Debbie Kraft
         and Andy and Jennifer Koplin all of Wisconsin; her great grandparents, Kate Larson, Gary and Patty Thompson,
         Elaine and Ron Kraft, and Dale and Marlene Koplin; her aunts, Molly and Maggie Kraft and Marlee Koplin; as well
         as numerous extended family members and friends who have shown support to the Kraft family.</p>
      <p>Hallie was born at Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids on January 12, 2017 to Corey P. and Candace J.
         (Mallory) Kraft. She was welcomed to the family by her sister Aubree, and later she welcomed her younger sister
         Colie.</p>
      <p>In just three short years, Hallie filled the lives of those she touched with exuberant love and laughter. Her
         sparkling personality was larger than this life. Although her time with us was brief, she was a star that
         burned brightly. She illuminated our lives, and reflected the love of Jesus on others.</p>
      <p>She was vivacious. Her whole face lit up the room when she looked in the faces of others. She was always so
         excited to greet others, and her enthusiasm always made you feel loved. Her wide eyed wonder, awe and delight
         in discovery helped others rediscover the wonder of God around us.</p>
      <p>She lavished her love on others. She was a doting big sister and an adoring little sister. She enjoyed cuddling
         and would frequently stop by for a quick snuggle on your lap.</p>
      <p>She was a tenacious, inquisitive girl, determined to figure things out on her own. Nothing was insurmountable.
         She had no fear of tackling the impossible. Her faith was not easily dispelled, even in the face of great
         obstacles. She taught us much. Our hope for Hallie has been that God would use her fearless, bold, intensity to
         build up the kingdom of Jesus. And she did that as thousands came together in prayer for her.</p>
      <p>Hallie has taught us to praise the Lord in all circumstances and to hope in God when you're bereft of hope.</p>
      <p>She will be missed terribly.</p>
      <p><em>In this we have confidence and therefore we have hope, that nothing can separate Hallie from the love of
         God in Christ Jesus.</em></p>
      <p>Hallie will forever be remembered for her spunky and joyous nature and her contagious smile.</p>
